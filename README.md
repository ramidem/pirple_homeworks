# Hi!

For some reason, I felt like I have so much ever since the bootcamp started.
So I thought of taking up 3 more courses simultaneously, ES6: Keeping Up with JavaScript,
Python is Easy, and NodeJS Masterclass. LOL.

Then, come mid-part of the coding bootcamp and I barely visit Pirple.

But I am positive. I will finish these courses before ending the bootcamp. And,
I might even add Full Stack Web Dev with Flash and Data Mining with Python.

Ambitious.
